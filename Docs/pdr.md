| FR001          | Grammar checking and text polishing         | As a user, I want to be able to select text in any application on Windows, press Ctrl + Win + A, and have the selected text replaced with a polished version, so that I can communicate more clearly with my peers or provide clearer comments. | The system should send a request to the AI via API with a prompt like "Check grammar and polish: #my text#". While processing, the user should see an animation. |
| FR002          | Closing the application                     | As a user, I want to be able to exit the application by right-clicking the icon in the taskbar and selecting "Exit" from the popup menu.                                                                                                        | The system should close the application.                                                                                                                         |
| FR003          | Entering OpenAI API keys and other settings | As a user, I want to be able to open the settings window and enter my OpenAI API key and other API settings, so the program can use them to connect to the AI.                                                                                  | The system should store settings securely. I have an Azure account and want to use ChatGPT hosted in Azure, so settings should support this.                     |
